TO-DO MANAGER PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
---------------1. OVERVIEW
This application is a local task management system built with Python. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow
users to create, save, load, and manage multiple to-do lists. The project is designed with a modular architecture,
separating the visual interface from the file storage logic.

---------------2. FILE ARCHITECTURE
To maintain professional standards, the project is divided into the following files:

main.py: The entry point of the application. Contains the TodoApp class which manages the window, the buttons, and the
overall coordination of the program.

file_manager.py: Handles all disk operations. It is responsible for reading text files, writing task data, and
maintaining the registry of created lists.

ui_utils.py: Provides helper functions for graphical interactions, such as opening folder selection dialogs and
validating console inputs.

paths.txt: A system-generated file that acts as a central database for the locations of all task lists created by the
user.

---------------3. CORE FUNCTIONALITIES
List Creation: Users can generate new .txt files within the application directory.

Data Persistence: Tasks are saved to the hard drive in UTF-8 format, ensuring they are available after the program is
closed.

Task Management: Supports adding individual tasks, deleting selected items, and a "Clear All" function for resetting
a list.

Safe Operations: Utilizes confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (deleting/clearing) to protect user data.

---------------4. INSTALLATION AND USAGE
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on the system.

Place all project files (main.py, file_manager.py, ui_utils.py) into a single dedicated folder.

Open a command prompt or terminal in that folder.

Execute the command: python main.py

Use the on-screen buttons or the 'File' menu at the top to begin managing tasks.

---------------5. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
GUI Framework: Tkinter (Standard Python Library).

Encoding: UTF-8 (Standard for text compatibility).

Path Handling: Absolute pathing via the OS module to ensure portability across different directories.
